Running Test Cases:
For any test case, run using 'cargo run <test_x_file>'.
The file must have the .x suffix or it will panic from being an invalid file.
The resulting xhtml file (if the program doesn't panic) will have the same
name as the .x file.

Example: 
Testing file: testcase1.x
Resulting file: testcase1.xhtml

The only sources I used were the Rust guidebook and StackOverflow posts to 
help understand and figure out errors.
